# Uber-Analysis
﻿
## Challenge #1 (Data Preparation)
• During my data preparation, i noticed that not all the csv files have the same columns and have variable data, except for the file names beginning with uber-raw-data. Hence i segmented only the files consisiting like so and put them in one combined dataframe and used it to perform different analysis
• I then checked for any missing values

## Challenge #2(Temporal Analysis)
• Here, I used the 'Date/Time' column to get the date time stamps and used them to manipulate and get the three desired outputs, which were
• distribution of time pickup drivers spent in a week
    • distribution in hours
    • distribution in hour of the day
• They were displayed as bar-plots for convenience.
